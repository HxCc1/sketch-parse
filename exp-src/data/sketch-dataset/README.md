Test data and labels : the zipped folder PNG_untouched.zip (present in this folder) contains the test sketches and the zipped folder  test_GT.zip (also present in this folder) contains the corresponding ground truth labels, please keep them in this folder after extracting. [This file](https://github.com/val-iisc/sketch-parse/blob/master/exp-src/data/sketch-dataset/pose_test_labels.txt) contains pose labels of test sketches. Mapping for each class label to part name is provided in [this](https://github.com/val-iisc/sketch-parse/blob/master/exp-src/data/sketch-dataset/Cls2Part.m) file. The labels are in the range of about 0 to 10 only, so they will look black if you directly view them as images. You can visualize these images directly without any processing by using the matlab command imagesc or python command matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.
