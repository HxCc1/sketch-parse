Test data and labels : please download files from [here (contains sketches)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xvewg2452x69k9f/PNG_untouched.zip?dl=0) and [here (contains sketch annotations)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ngidvtfbheylsq/test_GT.zip?dl=0) and keep them in this folder after extracting. [This file](https://github.com/val-iisc/sketch-parse/blob/master/exp-src/data/sketch-dataset/pose_test_labels.txt) contains pose labels of test sketches. Mapping for each class label to part name is provided in [this](https://github.com/val-iisc/sketch-parse/blob/master/exp-src/data/sketch-dataset/Cls2Part.m) file. The labels are in the range of about 0 to 10 only, so they will look black if you directly view them as images. You can visualize these images directly without any processing by using the matlab command imagesc or python command matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.
